       		<h5>Why we use containers?</h5>
       		<p>Containers are a portable unit, we can deploy, run and test in any platform without considering 
       		the host machine/ server software and hardware configurations. 
			Containers allow to specify the memory, CPU, and disk space need to use from the host. Multiple 
			applications can deploy on one instance using containers. 
			Containers are independent of other container services, so developers can independently update 
			containers without conflicts.  Containers also allow to track versions of the application and has 
			the facility to roll back the deployments.

       		More focus on developer and system operator requirements to separate the application dependencies from 
       		the infrastructure.
